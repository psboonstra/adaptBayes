#DESCRIPTION: Program for fitting a GLM equipped with the 'standard' prior evaluated
#in Boonstra and Barbaro, which is the regularized horseshoe. It has two intended uses:
#compile stan scripts or analyze data. First, if the user provides nothing but a valid
#'stan_path', then the stan script is compiled. Second, the user provides both a compiled
#stanfit object as well asvalues for y, x_standardized, #, q, and any other desired
#arguments to actually fit a regression.
#
#
#ARGUMENTS:
#
#stan_fit: an R object of class stanfit, which allows the function to run without recompiling the stan code.
#
#stan_path: (character) a path pointing to a .stan file, which indicates the stan code to compile and run. If
#both stan_fit and stan_path are provided, stan_fit takes precedence.
#
#y (vector) outcomes corresponding to the type of glm desired. This should match whatever datatype is expected
#by the stan program.
#
#x_standardized (matrix) matrix of numeric values with number of rows equal to the length of y and number of columns
#equal to p+q. It is assumed without verification that each column is standardized to whatever scale the prior
#expects - in Boonstra and Barbaro, all predictors are marginally generated to have mean zero and unit variance, so no
#standardization is conducted. In practice, all data should be standardized to have a common scale before model fitting.
#If regression coefficients on the natural scale are desired, they be easily obtained through unstandardizing.
#
#p, q (nonneg. integers) numbers, the sum of which add up to the number of columns in x_standardized. For the standard
#prior, this distinction is only needed if a different constant scale parameter (beta_orig_scale, beta_aug_scale), which is
#the constant 'c' in the notation of Boonstra and Barbaro, is used.
#
#beta_orig_scale, beta_aug_scale (pos. real) constants indicating the prior scale of the horseshoe. Both values correspond
#to 'c' in the notation of Boonstra and Barbaro, because that paper never considers beta_orig_scale!=beta_aug_scale
#
#local_dof, global_dof (pos. integer) numbers indicating the degrees of freedom for lambda_j and tau, respectively. Boonstra,
#et al. never considered local_dof != 1 or global_dof != 1.
#
#slab_precision (pos. real) the slab-part of the regularized horseshoe, this is equivalent to (1/d)^2 in the notation of
#Boonstra and Barbaro
#
#intercept_offset (vector) vector of 0's and 1's equal having the same length as y. Those observations with a value of 1
#have an additional constant offset in their linear predictor, effectively a different intercept. This is useful to jointly
#regress two datasets in which it is believed that the regression coefficients are the same but not the intercepts and could be
#useful (but was not used) in the simulation study to compare to a benchmark, namely if both the historical and current datasets
#were available but there is a desire to adjust for potentially different baseline prevalences.
#
#only_prior (logical) should all data be ignored, sampling only from the prior?
#
#ntries (pos. integer) the stan function will run up to this many times, stopping either when the number of
#*divergent transitions* is zero or when ntries has been reached. The reported fit will be that with the fewest number of
#divergent iterations.
