#DESCRIPTION: Program for fitting a GLM equipped with a regularized student-t prior on the regression coefficients,
#parametrized using the normal-inverse-gamma distribution. The 'regularization' refers to the fact that the inverse-gamma
#scale is has a finite upper bound that it smoothly approaches. This method was not used in the simulation study but was used
#in the data analysis. Specifically, it corresponds to 'PedRESC2'.
#
#
#ARGUMENTS: (only those distinct from glm_standard are discussed)
#
#beta_scale (pos. real) constants indicating the prior scale of the student-t prior.
#
#dof (pos. integer) degrees of freedom for the student-t prior

#' Program for fitting a GLM equipped with a regularized student-t prior on the regression
#' coefficients, parametrized using the normal-inverse-gamma distribution. The 'regularization'

#'
#' @param stan_fit an R object of class stanfit, which allows the function to run
#' without recompiling the stan code.
#' @param stan_path (character) a path pointing to a .stan file, which indicates
#' the stan code to compile and run. If both stan_fit and stan_path are provided,
#' stan_fit takes precedence.
#' @param y (vector) outcomes corresponding to the type of glm desired. This should
#' match whatever datatype is expected by the stan program.
#' @param x_standardized (matrix) matrix of numeric values with number of rows equal
#' to the length of y and number of columns equal to p+q. It is assumed without
#' verification that each column is standardized to whatever scale the prior
#' expects - in Boonstra and Barbaro, all predictors are marginally generated to have
#' mean zero and unit variance, so no standardization is conducted. In practice,
#' all data should be standardized to have a common scale before model fitting.
#' If regression coefficients on the natural scale are desired, they be easily obtained
#' through unstandardizing.
#' @param beta_scale (pos. real) constants indicating the prior scale of the student-t prior.
#' @param dof (pos. integer) degrees of freedom for the student-t prior
#' @param slab_precision (pos. real) the slab-part of the regularized horseshoe,
#' this is equivalent to (1/d)^2 in the notation of Boonstra and Barbaro
#' @param only_prior (logical) should all data be ignored, sampling only from the prior?
#' @param mc_warmup number of MCMC warm-up iterations
#' @param mc_iter_after_warmup number of MCMC iterations after warm-up
#' @param mc_chains number of MCMC chains
#' @param mc_thin every nth draw to keep
#' @param mc_stepsize positive stepsize
#' @param mc_adapt_delta between 0 and 1
#' @param mc_max_treedepth max tree depth
#' @param ntries (pos. integer) the stan function will run up to this many times,
#' stopping either when the number of divergent transitions* is zero or when ntries
#' has been reached. The reported fit will be that with the fewest number of divergent iterations.
#'
#' @return \code{list} object containing the draws and other information.
